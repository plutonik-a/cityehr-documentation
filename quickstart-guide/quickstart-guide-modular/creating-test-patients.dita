        <p>To continue exploring cityEHR you will need a larger sample of test patients – these can
            be generated using functions available on the Administration page, which is accessed by
            pressing the Administration button on the main system menu (top right of the page). </p>
        <ol id="ol_yqr_14v_vcc">
            <li>
                <p>On the Administration page, in the menu in the left hand pane, select the menu
                    option “Database” and then the sub-task for ‘Generate Test Data’. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Press the Browse button to load a file containing a sample patient record. </p>

        <ol id="ol_brr_14v_vcc">
            <li>
                <p>Press the ‘Browse’ button and navigate to your downloaded User Resources Folder.
                    Select the file called: <i>EHR_Extract-TimothyAbernathy.xml</i> (If you want to see
                    what this file looks like, then you can open it separately using a programmers
                    file editor or plain text editor). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The User Resources Folder is the folder you created when you downloaded User
                    resources in Section 4, which should look similar to Figure 41. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After uploading the <i>EHR_Extract-TimothyAbernathy.xml</i> file you should see the full set of options for generating test data, as shown in Figure 42 </p>

            <li>
                <p>By default, the parameters are set to generate 10 test records, split evenly
                    between male, female and other gender categories, aged between 18 and 65. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To test these features this example will generate records for Male and Female
                    patients, so you can change the percentages to 50 in each of these columns, and
                    percentages of 0 to the rest (Non-binary, Intersex, and Unknown). The actual
                    number of records to be generated will change as you change the percentages (and an error message will appear whenever the percentages don’t add up to 10). If you would like, once you have generated the 10 records, you can keep the same settings and try generating 100 records. However, be aware that it can take up to 5 seconds to generate each record, so 100 records can take over 5 minutes to complete. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Note that the button to generate test patients will only be active when the
                    percentages across all categories add up to 100% </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the columns for Male and Female patients, change the Forename selection to
                    Male Forename and Female Forename as appropriate. </p>

            <li>
                <p>Once you are happy with the parameters, press the small button on the right hand
                    side of the page to generate the test records. You will need to wait a while
                    until this process is finished. </p>
